# Nice to meet You !, I'm Agung üñêÔ∏è

I currently work at [PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa](https://mopakha.id) as a Climatology and Hydrology Analyst. I'm currently developing further the fire risk model for forest and land fires forecast in peatlands from a weather perspective. My work often uses R and Python for model development, as well as analysis of climate and hydrological data. Now, I'm learning more about Python for data visualization with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for developing web-based applications, especially for my work.

## Projects

Currently, I'm working on developing a web-based application for forest and land fire risk forecasting in peatlands. The application is developed using Python with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) package (previously in [R language with Shiny package](https://shiny.posit.co). Unfortunately, The application I made is only used for internal staff. I use [Weather Research Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) as an input to fire risk model. Also, I make an automation script in R so that the model can updated daily.  

Other individual project, like developing the R package for installing and post-processing the [Weather Research Forecasting](https://github.com/agungbaruna/Rwrf) is still under development. The package is intended to make it easier for installing WRF and visualizing the output.
